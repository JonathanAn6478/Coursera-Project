# Coursera-Project
This is the project of getting and cleaning data course.

The included R script, run_analysis.R, conducts the following:

1.Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.

2.Read both the train and test datasets and the data feature, activity info.

3.Merge the datasets for training data, testing data and subject data, then merge the outputs into a final dataset.

4.Extract data by kept only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.

5.Uses descriptive activity names for corresponding id and adjust the variable names appropriately.

6.Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The output for this project is shown in tidy_dataset.txt.
